Pelican now has a blog of its own!

:date: 2012-07-23

Since Alexis started working on this almost two years ago, a bunch of happy
hackers joined the effort to make pelican a better tool, again and again. Into
other people we have `Kyle <http://kylefuller.co.uk/>`_, `Justin
<https://github.com/justinmayer>`_ and `tBunnyMan <http://bunnyman.info/>`_ who
have done an amazing job recently.

I thought having a project blog would be a good idea to keep users and
developers updated on the status of pelican's development.

We have a 3.0 version coming with *a lot* of niceties in there which will
hopefully be ready by the end of the week. Kyle is working on py3k support for
integration after 3.0, and we are getting rid of old things that don't make
sense anymore for 3.0, so expect some change :)
