Pelican now has a blog on its own!

:date: 2012-07-23

Since Alexis started working on this almost one year ago, a bunch of happy
hackers joined the effort to make pelican a better tool, again and again, so I
thought having a blog on its own for the project could be a good idea.

We'll try to keep you up to date with the latests evolutions of pelican here.
We have a 3.0 version coming with *a lot* of niceties in there, Kyle is working
on py3k support and we'll get rid of some stuff that doesn't make sence, but
you'll see that when it's ready, hopefully by end of week.
