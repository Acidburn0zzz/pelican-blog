The pelican's blog
##################

This is the pelican's project weblog. You can add content to it by forking it
or pushing direcly on the pelican server.

The makefile has a rule to do that for you, when you're ready to publish, and
if you have the rights, you just have to type::

    make upload

and it will generate the content locally and upload it on the server :)
